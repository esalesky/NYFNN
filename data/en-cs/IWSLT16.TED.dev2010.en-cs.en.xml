<title> What comes after An Inconvenient Truth?</title> 
<seg id="1"> Last year I showed these two slides so that demonstrate that the arctic ice cap, which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower 48 states, has shrunk by 40 percent.  </seg>
<seg id="2"> But this understates the seriousness of this particular problem because it doesn't show the thickness of the ice.  </seg>
<seg id="3"> The arctic ice cap is, in a sense, the beating heart of the global climate system.  </seg>
<seg id="4"> It expands in winter and contracts in summer.  </seg>
<seg id="5"> The next slide I show you will be a rapid fast-forward of what's happened over the last 25 years.  </seg>
<seg id="6"> The permanent ice is marked in red.  </seg>
<seg id="7"> As you see, it expands to the dark blue -- that's the annual ice in winter, and it contracts in summer.  </seg>
<seg id="8"> The so-called permanent ice, five years old or older, you can see is almost like blood, spilling out of the body here.  </seg>
<seg id="9"> In 25 years it's gone from this, to this.  </seg>
<seg id="10"> This is a problem because the warming heats up the frozen ground around the Arctic Ocean, where there is a massive amount of frozen carbon which, when it thaws, is turned into methane by microbes.  </seg>
<seg id="11"> Compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere, that amount could double if we cross this tipping point.  </seg>
<seg id="12"> Already in some shallow lakes in Alaska, methane is actively bubbling up out of the water.  </seg>
<seg id="13"> Professor Katey Walter from the University of Alaska went out with another team to another shallow lake last winter.  </seg>
<seg id="14"> Whoa!  </seg>
<seg id="15"> She's okay. The question is whether we will be.  </seg>
<seg id="16"> And one reason is, this enormous heat sink heats up Greenland from the north.  </seg>
<seg id="17"> This is an annual melting river.  </seg>
<seg id="18"> But the volumes are much larger than ever.  </seg>
<seg id="19"> This is the Kangerlussuaq River in southwest Greenland.  </seg>
<seg id="20"> If you want to know how sea level rises from land-base ice melting this is where it reaches the sea.  </seg>
<seg id="21"> These flows are increasing very rapidly.  </seg>
<seg id="22"> At the other end of the planet, Antarctica the largest mass of ice on the planet.  </seg>
<seg id="23"> Last month scientists reported the entire continent is now in negative ice balance.  </seg>
<seg id="24"> And west Antarctica cropped up on top some under-sea islands, is particularly rapid in its melting.  </seg>
<seg id="25"> That's equal to 20 feet of sea level, as is Greenland.  </seg>
<seg id="26"> In the Himalayas, the third largest mass of ice: at the top you see new lakes, which a few years ago were glaciers.  </seg>
<seg id="27"> 40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their drinking water from that melting flow.  </seg>
<seg id="28"> In the Andes, this glacier is the source of drinking water for this city.  </seg>
<seg id="29"> The flows have increased.  </seg>
<seg id="30"> But when they go away, so does much of the drinking water.  </seg>
<seg id="31"> In California there has been a 40 percent decline in the Sierra snowpack.  </seg>
<seg id="32"> This is hitting the reservoirs.  </seg>
<seg id="33"> And the predictions, as you've read, are serious.  </seg>
<seg id="34"> This drying around the world has lead to a dramatic increase in fires.  </seg>
<seg id="35"> And the disasters around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary and unprecedented rate.  </seg>
<seg id="36"> Four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75.  </seg>
<seg id="37"> This is a completely unsustainable pattern.  </seg>
<seg id="38"> If you look at in the context of history you can see what this is doing.  </seg>
<seg id="39"> In the last five years we've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day to the oceans.  </seg>
<seg id="40"> Look carefully at the area of the eastern Pacific, from the Americas, extending westward, and on either side of the Indian subcontinent, where there is a radical depletion of oxygen in the oceans.  </seg>
<seg id="41"> The biggest single cause of global warming, along with deforestation, which is 20 percent of it, is the burning of fossil fuels.  </seg>
<seg id="42"> Oil is a problem, and coal is the most serious problem.  </seg>
<seg id="43"> The United States is one of the two largest emitters, along with China.  </seg>
<seg id="44"> And the proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants.  </seg>
<seg id="45"> But we're beginning to see a sea change.  </seg>
<seg id="46"> Here are the ones that have been cancelled in the last few years with some green alternatives proposed.  </seg>
<seg id="47"> However there is a political battle in our country.  </seg>
<seg id="48"> And the coal industries and the oil industries spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last calendar year promoting clean coal, which is an oxymoron.  </seg>
<seg id="49"> That image reminded me of something.  </seg>
<seg id="50"> Around Christmas, in my home in Tennessee, a billion gallons of coal sludge was spilled.  </seg>
<seg id="51"> You probably saw it on the news.  </seg>
<seg id="52"> This, all over the country, is the second largest waste stream in America.  </seg>
<seg id="53"> This happened around Christmas.  </seg>
<seg id="54"> One of the coal industry's ads around Christmas was this one.  </seg>
<seg id="55"> Frosty the coal man is a jolly, happy soul.  </seg>
<seg id="56"> He's abundant here in America, and he helps our economy grow.  </seg>
<seg id="57"> Frosty the coal man is getting cleaner everyday.  </seg>
<seg id="58"> He's affordable and adorable, and workers keep their pay.  </seg>
<seg id="59"> This is the source of much of the coal in West Virginia.  </seg>
<seg id="60"> The largest mountaintop miner is the head of Massey Coal.  </seg>
<seg id="61"> Let me be clear about it. Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, they don't know what they're talking about.  </seg>
<seg id="62"> So the Alliance for Climate Protection has launched two campaigns.  </seg>
<seg id="63"> This is one of them, part of one of them.  </seg>
<seg id="64"> At COALergy we view climate change as a very serious threat to our business.  </seg>
<seg id="65"> That's why we've made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an advertising effort to help bring out and complicate the truth about coal.  </seg>
<seg id="66"> The fact is, coal isn't dirty.  </seg>
<seg id="67"> We think it's clean -- smells good, too.  </seg>
<seg id="68"> So don't worry about climate change.  </seg>
<seg id="69"> Leave that up to us.  </seg>
<seg id="70"> Clean coal -- you've heard a lot about it.  </seg>
<seg id="71"> So let's take a tour of this state-of-the-art clean coal facility.  </seg>
<seg id="72"> Amazing! The machinery is kind of loud.  </seg>
<seg id="73"> But that's the sound of clean coal technology.  </seg>
<seg id="74"> And while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming, the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything.  </seg>
<seg id="75"> Take a good long look: this is today's clean coal technology.  </seg>
<seg id="76"> Finally, the positive alternative meshes with our economic challenge and our national security challenge.  </seg>
<seg id="77"> America is in crisis -- the economy, national security, the climate crisis.  </seg>
<seg id="78"> The thread that links them all: our addiction to carbon based fuels, like dirty coal and foreign oil.  </seg>
<seg id="79"> But now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess.  </seg>
<seg id="80"> Repower America with 100 percent clean electricity within 10 years.  </seg>
<seg id="81"> A plan to put America back to work, make us more secure, and help stop global warming.  </seg>
<seg id="82"> Finally, a solution that's big enough to solve our problems.  </seg>
<seg id="83"> Repower America. Find out more.  </seg>
<seg id="84"> This is the last one.  </seg>
<seg id="85"> It's about repowering America.  </seg>
<seg id="86"> One of the fastest ways to cut our dependence on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet.  </seg>
<seg id="87"> Future's over here. Wind, sun, a new energy grid.  </seg>
<seg id="88"> New investments to create high-paying jobs.  </seg>
<seg id="89"> Repower America. It's time to get real.  </seg>
<seg id="90"> There is an old African proverb that says, "If you want to go quickly, go alone.  </seg>
<seg id="91"> If you want to go far, go together."  </seg>
<seg id="92"> We need to go far, quickly.  </seg>
<seg id="93"> Thank you very much.  </seg>

<description>Elizabeth Gilbert muses on the impossible things we expect from artists and geniuses -- and shares the radical idea that, instead of the rare person "being" a genius, all of us "have" a genius. It's a funny, personal and surprisingly moving talk.</description>

<talkid>453</talkid> 
<title>Elizabeth Gilbert: Your elusive creative genius</title> 
<seg id="1"> I am a writer.  </seg>
<seg id="2"> Writing books is my profession but it's more than that, of course.  </seg>
<seg id="3"> It is also my great lifelong love and fascination.  </seg>
<seg id="4"> And I don't expect that that's ever going to change.  </seg>
<seg id="5"> But, that said, something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career, which has caused me to have to recalibrate my whole relationship with this work.  </seg>
<seg id="6"> And the peculiar thing is that I recently wrote this book, this memoir called "Eat, Pray, Love" which, decidedly unlike any of my previous books, went out in the world for some reason, and became this big, mega-sensation, international bestseller thing.  </seg>
<seg id="7"> The result of which is that everywhere I go now, people treat me like I'm doomed.  </seg>
<seg id="8"> Seriously -- doomed, doomed!  </seg>
<seg id="9"> Like, they come up to me now, all worried, and they say, "Aren't you afraid you're never going to be able to top that?  </seg>
<seg id="10"> Aren't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life and you're never again going to create a book that anybody in the world cares about at all, ever again?"  </seg>
<seg id="11"> So that's reassuring, you know.  </seg>
<seg id="12"> But it would be worse, except for that I happen to remember that over 20 years ago, when I first started telling people -- when I was a teenager -- that I wanted to be a writer, I was met with this same kind of, sort of fear-based reaction.  </seg>
<seg id="13"> And people would say, "Aren't you afraid you're never going to have any success?  </seg>
<seg id="14"> Aren't you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you?  </seg>
<seg id="15"> Aren't you afraid that you're going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing's ever going to come of it and you're going to die on a scrap heap of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bitter ash of failure?"  </seg>
<seg id="16"> Like that, you know.  </seg>
<seg id="17"> The answer -- the short answer to all those questions is, "Yes."  </seg>
<seg id="18"> Yes, I'm afraid of all those things.  </seg>
<seg id="19"> And I always have been.  </seg>
<seg id="20"> And I'm afraid of many, many more things besides that people can't even guess at, like seaweed and other things that are scary.  </seg>
<seg id="21"> But, when it comes to writing, the thing that I've been sort of thinking about lately, and wondering about lately, is why?  </seg>
<seg id="22"> You know, is it rational?  </seg>
<seg id="23"> Is it logical that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do.  </seg>
<seg id="24"> And what is it specifically about creative ventures that seems to make us really nervous about each other's mental health in a way that other careers kind of don't do, you know?  </seg>
<seg id="25"> Like my dad, for example, was a chemical engineer and I don't recall once in his 40 years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer, you know?  </seg>
<seg id="26"> It didn't -- that chemical-engineering block, John, how's it going?  </seg>
<seg id="27"> It just didn't come up like that, you know?  </seg>
<seg id="28"> But to be fair, chemical engineers as a group haven't really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alcoholic manic-depressives.  </seg>
<seg id="29"> We writers, we kind of do have that reputation, and not just writers, but creative people across all genres, it seems, have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable.  </seg>
<seg id="30"> And all you have to do is look at the very grim death count in the 20th century alone, of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands, you know?  </seg>
<seg id="31"> And even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide seem to be really undone by their gifts, you know.  </seg>
<seg id="32"> Norman Mailer, just before he died, last interview, he said "Every one of my books has killed me a little more."  </seg>
<seg id="33"> An extraordinary statement to make about your life's work.  </seg>
<seg id="34"> But we don't even blink when we hear somebody say this because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we've completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that artistry, in the end, will always ultimately lead to anguish.  </seg>
<seg id="35"> And the question that I want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea?  </seg>
<seg id="36"> Are you comfortable with that?  </seg>
<seg id="37"> Because you look at it even from an inch away and, you know ...  </seg>
<seg id="38"> I'm not at all comfortable with that assumption.  </seg>
<seg id="39"> I think it's odious.  </seg>
<seg id="40"> And I also think it's dangerous, and I don't want to see it perpetuated into the next century.  </seg>
<seg id="41"> I think it's better if we encourage our great creative minds to live.  </seg>
<seg id="42"> And I definitely know that, in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption, particularly given the circumstance that I'm in right now in my career.  </seg>
<seg id="43"> Which is -- you know, like check it out, I'm pretty young, I'm only about 40 years old.  </seg>
<seg id="44"> I still have maybe another four decades of work left in me.  </seg>
<seg id="45"> And it's exceedingly likely that anything I write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book, right?  </seg>
<seg id="46"> I should just put it bluntly, because we're all sort of friends here now -- it's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me.  </seg>
<seg id="47"> So Jesus, what a thought!  </seg>
<seg id="48"> That's the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine o'clock in the morning, and I don't want to go there.  </seg>
<seg id="49"> I would prefer to keep doing this work that I love.  </seg>
<seg id="50"> And so, the question becomes, how?  </seg>
<seg id="51"> And so, it seems to me, upon a lot of reflection, that the way that I have to work now, in order to continue writing, is that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct, right?  </seg>
<seg id="52"> I have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance between me, as I am writing, and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be, from now on.  </seg>
<seg id="53"> And, as I've been looking over the last year for models for how to do that I've been sort of looking across time, and I've been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help creative people, sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity.  </seg>
<seg id="54"> And that search has led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome.  </seg>
<seg id="55"> So stay with me, because it does circle around and back.  </seg>
<seg id="56"> But, ancient Greece and ancient Rome -- people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then, O.K.?  </seg>
<seg id="57"> People believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source, for distant and unknowable reasons.  </seg>
<seg id="58"> The Greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity "daemons."  </seg>
<seg id="59"> Socrates, famously, believed that he had a daemon who spoke wisdom to him from afar.  </seg>
<seg id="60"> The Romans had the same idea, but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius.  </seg>
<seg id="61"> Which is great, because the Romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual.  </seg>
<seg id="62"> They believed that a genius was this, sort of magical divine entity, who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist's studio, kind of like Dobby the house elf, and who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artist with their work and would shape the outcome of that work.  </seg>
<seg id="63"> So brilliant -- there it is, right there, that distance that I'm talking about -- that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work.  </seg>
<seg id="64"> And everyone knew that this is how it functioned, right?  </seg>
<seg id="65"> So the ancient artist was protected from certain things, like, for example, too much narcissism, right?  </seg>
<seg id="66"> If your work was brilliant you couldn't take all the credit for it, everybody knew that you had this disembodied genius who had helped you.  </seg>
<seg id="67"> If your work bombed, not entirely your fault, you know?  </seg>
<seg id="68"> Everyone knew your genius was kind of lame.  </seg>
<seg id="69"> And this is how people thought about creativity in the West for a really long time.  </seg>
<seg id="70"> And then the Renaissance came and everything changed, and we had this big idea, and the big idea was let's put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all gods and mysteries, and there's no more room for mystical creatures who take dictation from the divine.  </seg>
<seg id="71"> And it's the beginning of rational humanism, and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual.  </seg>
<seg id="72"> And for the first time in history, you start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius rather than having a genius.  </seg>
<seg id="73"> And I got to tell you, I think that was a huge error.  </seg>
<seg id="74"> You know, I think that allowing somebody, one mere person to believe that he or she is like, the vessel, you know, like the font and the essence and the source of all divine, creative, unknowable, eternal mystery is just a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile, human psyche.  </seg>
<seg id="75"> It's like asking somebody to swallow the sun.  </seg>
<seg id="76"> It just completely warps and distorts egos, and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance.  </seg>
<seg id="77"> And I think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years.  </seg>
<seg id="78"> And, if this is true, and I think it is true, the question becomes, what now?  </seg>
<seg id="79"> Can we do this differently?  </seg>
<seg id="80"> Maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery.  </seg>
<seg id="81"> Maybe not.  </seg>
<seg id="82"> Maybe we can't just erase 500 years of rational humanistic thought in one 18 minute speech.  </seg>
<seg id="83"> And there's probably people in this audience who would raise really legitimate scientific suspicions about the notion of, basically fairies who follow people around rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff.  </seg>
<seg id="84"> I'm not, probably, going to bring you all along with me on this.  </seg>
<seg id="85"> But the question that I kind of want to pose is -- you know, why not?  </seg>
<seg id="86"> Why not think about it this way?  </seg>
<seg id="87"> Because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process.  </seg>
<seg id="88"> A process which, as anybody who has ever tried to make something -- which is to say basically everyone here --- knows does not always behave rationally.  </seg>
<seg id="89"> And, in fact, can sometimes feel downright paranormal.  </seg>
<seg id="90"> I had this encounter recently where I met the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone, who's now in her 90s, but she's been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia, she would be out working in the fields, and she said she would feel and hear a poem coming at her from over the landscape.  </seg>
<seg id="91"> And she said it was like a thunderous train of air.  </seg>
<seg id="92"> And it would come barreling down at her over the landscape.  </seg>
<seg id="93"> And she felt it coming, because it would shake the earth under her feet.  </seg>
<seg id="94"> She knew that she had only one thing to do at that point, and that was to, in her words, "run like hell."  </seg>
<seg id="95"> And she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting chased by this poem, and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her, she could collect it and grab it on the page.  </seg>
<seg id="96"> And other times she wouldn't be fast enough, so she'd be running and running and running, and she wouldn't get to the house and the poem would barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape, looking, as she put it "for another poet."  </seg>
<seg id="97"> And then there were these times -- this is the piece I never forgot -- she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it, right?  </seg>
<seg id="98"> So, she's running to the house and she's looking for the paper and the poem passes through her, and she grabs a pencil just as it's going through her, and then she said, it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it.  </seg>
<seg id="99"> She would catch the poem by its tail, and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page.  </seg>
<seg id="100"> And in these instances, the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards, from the last word to the first.  </seg>
<seg id="101"> So when I heard that I was like -- that's uncanny, that's exactly what my creative process is like.  </seg>
<seg id="102"> That's not at all what my creative process is -- I'm not the pipeline!  </seg>
<seg id="103"> I'm a mule, and the way that I have to work is that I have to get up at the same time every day, and sweat and labor and barrel through it really awkwardly.  </seg>
<seg id="104"> But even I, in my mulishness, even I have brushed up against that thing, at times.  </seg>
<seg id="105"> And I would imagine that a lot of you have too.  </seg>
<seg id="106"> You know, even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I honestly cannot identify.  </seg>
<seg id="107"> And what is that thing?  </seg>
<seg id="108"> And how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds, but, in fact, might actually keep us sane?  </seg>
<seg id="109"> And for me, the best contemporary example that I have of how to do that is the musician Tom Waits, who I got to interview several years ago on a magazine assignment.  </seg>
<seg id="110"> And we were talking about this, and you know, Tom, for most of his life he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist, trying to control and manage and dominate these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses that were totally internalized.  </seg>
<seg id="111"> But then he got older, he got calmer, and one day he was driving down the freeway in Los Angeles he told me, and this is when it all changed for him.  </seg>
<seg id="112"> And he's speeding along, and all of a sudden he hears this little fragment of melody, that comes into his head as inspiration often comes, elusive and tantalizing, and he wants it, you know, it's gorgeous, and he longs for it, but he has no way to get it.  </seg>
<seg id="113"> He doesn't have a piece of paper, he doesn't have a pencil, he doesn't have a tape recorder.  </seg>
<seg id="114"> So he starts to feel all of that old anxiety start to rise in him like, "I'm going to lose this thing, and then I'm going to be haunted by this song forever.  </seg>
<seg id="115"> I'm not good enough, and I can't do it."  </seg>
<seg id="116"> And instead of panicking, he just stopped.  </seg>
<seg id="117"> He just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel.  </seg>
<seg id="118"> He just looked up at the sky, and he said, "Excuse me, can you not see that I'm driving?"  </seg>
<seg id="119"> "Do I look like I can write down a song right now?  </seg>
<seg id="120"> If you really want to exist, come back at a more opportune moment when I can take care of you.  </seg>
<seg id="121"> Otherwise, go bother somebody else today.  </seg>
<seg id="122"> Go bother Leonard Cohen."  </seg>
<seg id="123"> And his whole work process changed after that.  </seg>
<seg id="124"> Not the work, the work was still oftentimes as dark as ever.  </seg>
<seg id="125"> But the process, and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the genie, the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble, and released it kind of back where it came from, and realized that this didn't have to be this internalized, tormented thing.  </seg>
<seg id="126"> It could be this peculiar, wondrous, bizarre collaboration kind of conversation between Tom and the strange, external thing that was not quite Tom.  </seg>
<seg id="127"> So when I heard that story it started to shift a little bit the way that I worked too, and it already saved me once.  </seg>
<seg id="128"> This idea, it saved me when I was in the middle of writing "Eat, Pray, Love," and I fell into one of those, sort of pits of despair that we all fall into when we're working on something and it's not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster, this is going to be the worst book ever written.  </seg>
<seg id="129"> Not just bad, but the worst book ever written.  </seg>
<seg id="130"> And I started to think I should just dump this project.  </seg>
<seg id="131"> But then I remembered Tom talking to the open air and I tried it.  </seg>
<seg id="132"> So I just lifted my face up from the manuscript and I directed my comments to an empty corner of the room.  </seg>
<seg id="133"> And I said aloud, "Listen you, thing, you and I both know that if this book isn't brilliant that is not entirely my fault, right?  </seg>
<seg id="134"> Because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this, I don't have any more than this.  </seg>
<seg id="135"> So if you want it to be better, then you've got to show up and do your part of the deal.  </seg>
<seg id="136"> O.K. But if you don't do that, you know what, the hell with it.  </seg>
<seg id="137"> I'm going to keep writing anyway because that's my job.  </seg>
<seg id="138"> And I would please like the record to reflect today that I showed up for my part of the job."  </seg>
<seg id="139"> Because -- in the end it's like this, O.K. -- centuries ago in the deserts of North Africa, people used to gather for these moonlight dances of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours, until dawn.  </seg>
<seg id="140"> And they were always magnificent, because the dancers were professionals and they were terrific, right?  </seg>
<seg id="141"> But every once in a while, very rarely, something would happen, and one of these performers would actually become transcendent.  </seg>
<seg id="142"> And I know you know what I'm talking about, because I know you've all seen, at some point in your life, a performance like this.  </seg>
<seg id="143"> It was like time would stop, and the dancer would sort of step through some kind of portal and he wasn't doing anything different than he had ever done, 1,000 nights before, but everything would align.  </seg>
<seg id="144"> And all of a sudden, he would no longer appear to be merely human.  </seg>
<seg id="145"> He would be lit from within, and lit from below and all lit up on fire with divinity.  </seg>
<seg id="146"> And when this happened, back then, people knew it for what it was, you know, they called it by its name.  </seg>
<seg id="147"> They would put their hands together and they would start to chant, "Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God."  </seg>
<seg id="148"> That's God, you know.  </seg>
<seg id="149"> Curious historical footnote -- when the Moors invaded southern Spain, they took this custom with them and the pronunciation changed over the centuries from "Allah, Allah, Allah," to "Olé, olé, olé," which you still hear in bullfights and in flamenco dances.  </seg>
<seg id="150"> In Spain, when a performer has done something impossible and magic, "Allah, olé, olé, Allah, magnificent, bravo," incomprehensible, there it is -- a glimpse of God.  </seg>
<seg id="151"> Which is great, because we need that.  </seg>
<seg id="152"> But, the tricky bit comes the next morning, for the dancer himself, when he wakes up and discovers that it's Tuesday at 11 a.m., and he's no longer a glimpse of God.  </seg>
<seg id="153"> He's just an aging mortal with really bad knees, and maybe he's never going to ascend to that height again.  </seg>
<seg id="154"> And maybe nobody will ever chant God's name again as he spins, and what is he then to do with the rest of his life?  </seg>
<seg id="155"> This is hard.  </seg>
<seg id="156"> This is one of the most painful reconciliations to make in a creative life.  </seg>
<seg id="157"> But maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of anguish if you never happened to believe, in the first place, that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you.  </seg>
<seg id="158"> But maybe if you just believed that they were on loan to you from some unimaginable source for some exquisite portion of your life to be passed along when you're finished, with somebody else.  </seg>
<seg id="159"> And, you know, if we think about it this way it starts to change everything.  </seg>
<seg id="160"> This is how I've started to think, and this is certainly how I've been thinking in the last few months as I've been working on the book that will soon be published, as the dangerously, frighteningly over-anticipated follow up to my freakish success.  </seg>
<seg id="161"> And what I have to, sort of keep telling myself when I get really psyched out about that, is, don't be afraid.  </seg>
<seg id="162"> Don't be daunted.  </seg>
<seg id="163"> Just do your job.  </seg>
<seg id="164"> Continue to show up for your piece of it, whatever that might be.  </seg>
<seg id="165"> If your job is to dance, do your dance.  </seg>
<seg id="166"> If the divine, cockeyed genius assigned to your case decides to let some sort of wonderment be glimpsed, for just one moment through your efforts, then "Olé!"  </seg>
<seg id="167"> And if not, do your dance anyhow.  </seg>
<seg id="168"> And "Olé!" to you, nonetheless.  </seg>
<seg id="169"> I believe this and I feel that we must teach it.  </seg>
<seg id="170"> "Olé!" to you, nonetheless, just for having the sheer human love and stubbornness to keep showing up.  </seg>
<seg id="171"> Thank you.  </seg>
<seg id="172"> Thank you.  </seg>
<seg id="173"> Olé!  </seg>

<description>In this short talk from TED U 2009, Brian Cox shares what's new with the CERN supercollider. He covers the repairs now underway and what the future holds for the largest science experiment ever attempted.</description>

<talkid>531</talkid> 
<title>Brian Cox: What went wrong at the LHC</title> 
<seg id="1"> Last year at TED I gave an introduction to the LHC.  </seg>
<seg id="2"> And I promised to come back and give you an update on how that machine worked.  </seg>
<seg id="3"> So this is it. And for those of you that weren't there, the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted -- 27 kilometers in circumference.  </seg>
<seg id="4"> Its job is to recreate the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began, up to 600 million times a second.  </seg>
<seg id="5"> It's nothing if not ambitious.  </seg>
<seg id="6"> This is the machine below Geneva.  </seg>
<seg id="7"> We take the pictures of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors.  </seg>
<seg id="8"> This is the one I work on. It's called the ATLAS detector -- 44 meters wide, 22 meters in diameter.  </seg>
<seg id="9"> Spectacular picture here of ATLAS under construction so you can see the scale.  </seg>
<seg id="10"> On the 10th of September last year we turned the machine on for the first time.  </seg>
<seg id="11"> And this picture was taken by ATLAS.  </seg>
<seg id="12"> It caused immense celebration in the control room.  </seg>
<seg id="13"> It's a picture of the first beam particle going all the way around the LHC, colliding with a piece of the LHC deliberately, and showering particles into the detector.  </seg>
<seg id="14"> In other words, when we saw that picture on September 10th we knew the machine worked, which is a great triumph.  </seg>
<seg id="15"> I don't know whether this got the biggest cheer, or this, when someone went onto Google and saw the front page was like that.  </seg>
<seg id="16"> It means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact.  </seg>
<seg id="17"> About a week later we had a problem with the machine, related actually to these bits of wire here -- these gold wires.  </seg>
<seg id="18"> Those wires carry 13 thousand amps when the machine is working in full power.  </seg>
<seg id="19"> Now the engineers amongst you will look at them and say, "No they don't. They're small wires."  </seg>
<seg id="20"> They can do that because when they are very cold they are what's called superconducting wire.  </seg>
<seg id="21"> So at minus 271 degrees, colder than the space between the stars, those wires can take that current.  </seg>
<seg id="22"> In one of the joints between over 9,000 magnets in LHC, there was a manufacturing defect.  </seg>
<seg id="23"> So the wire heated up slightly, and its 13,000 amps suddenly encountered electrical resistance.  </seg>
<seg id="24"> This was the result.  </seg>
<seg id="25"> Now that's more impressive when you consider those magnets weigh over 20 tons, and they moved about a foot.  </seg>
<seg id="26"> So we damaged about 50 of the magnets.  </seg>
<seg id="27"> We had to take them out, which we did.  </seg>
<seg id="28"> We reconditioned them all, fixed them.  </seg>
<seg id="29"> They're all on their way back underground now.  </seg>
<seg id="30"> By the end of March the LHC will be intact again.  </seg>
<seg id="31"> We will switch it on, and we expect to take data in June or July, and continue with our quest to find out what the building blocks of the universe are.  </seg>
<seg id="32"> Now of course, in a way those accidents reignite the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge. It's easy to refute.  </seg>
<seg id="33"> I think that the fact that it's so difficult, the fact that we're overreaching, is the value of things like the LHC.  </seg>
<seg id="34"> I will leave the final word to an English scientist, Humphrey Davy, who, I suspect, when defending his protege's useless experiments -- his protege was Michael Faraday -- said this, "Nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assume that our views of science are ultimate, that there are no mysteries in nature, that our triumphs are complete, and that there are no new worlds to conquer."  </seg>
<seg id="35"> Thank you.  </seg>

<url>http://www.ted.com/talks/barry_schwartz_on_the_paradox_of_choice</url> 
<description>Psychologist Barry Schwartz takes aim at a central tenet of western societies: freedom of choice. In Schwartz's estimation, choice has made us not freer but more paralyzed, not happier but more dissatisfied.</description>

<talkid>93</talkid> 
<title>Barry Schwartz: The paradox of choice</title> 
<seg id="1"> I'm going to talk to you about some stuff that's in this book of mine that I hope will resonate with other things you've already heard, and I'll try to make some connections myself, in case you miss them.  </seg>
<seg id="2"> I want to start with what I call the "official dogma."  </seg>
<seg id="3"> The official dogma of what?  </seg>
<seg id="4"> The official dogma of all western industrial societies.  </seg>
<seg id="5"> And the official dogma runs like this: if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens, the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom.  </seg>
<seg id="6"> The reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good, valuable, worthwhile, essential to being human.  </seg>
<seg id="7"> And because if people have freedom, then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maximize our welfare, and no one has to decide on our behalf.  </seg>
<seg id="8"> The way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice.  </seg>
<seg id="9"> The more choice people have, the more freedom they have, and the more freedom they have, the more welfare they have.  </seg>
<seg id="10"> This, I think, is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn't occur to anyone to question it.  </seg>
<seg id="11"> And it's also deeply embedded in our lives.  </seg>
<seg id="12"> I'll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us.  </seg>
<seg id="13"> This is my supermarket. Not such a big one.  </seg>
<seg id="14"> I want to say just a word about salad dressing.  </seg>
<seg id="15"> 175 salad dressings in my supermarket, if you don't count the 10 extra-virgin olive oils and 12 balsamic vinegars you could buy to make a very large number of your own salad dressings, in the off-chance that none of the 175 the store has on offer suit you.  </seg>
<seg id="16"> So this is what the supermarket is like.  </seg>
<seg id="17"> And then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stereo system -- speakers, CD player, tape player, tuner, amplifier -- and in this one single consumer electronics store, there are that many stereo systems.  </seg>
<seg id="18"> We can construct six-and-a-half-million different stereo systems out of the components that are on offer in one store.  </seg>
<seg id="19"> You've got to admit that's a lot of choice.  </seg>
<seg id="20"> In other domains -- the world of communications.  </seg>
<seg id="21"> There was a time, when I was a boy, when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted, as long as it came from Ma Bell.  </seg>
<seg id="22"> You rented your phone. You didn't buy it.  </seg>
<seg id="23"> One consequence of that, by the way, is that the phone never broke.  </seg>
<seg id="24"> And those days are gone.  </seg>
<seg id="25"> We now have an almost unlimited variety of phones, especially in the world of cell phones.  </seg>
<seg id="26"> These are cell phones of the future.  </seg>
<seg id="27"> My favorite is the middle one -- the MP3 player, nose hair trimmer, and creme brulee torch.  </seg>
<seg id="28"> And if by some chance you haven't seen that in your store yet, you can rest assured that one day soon you will.  </seg>
<seg id="29"> And what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question.  </seg>
<seg id="30"> And do you know what the answer to this question now is?  </seg>
<seg id="31"> The answer is "No."  </seg>
<seg id="32"> It is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much.  </seg>
<seg id="33"> So, in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things, the same explosion of choice is true.  </seg>
<seg id="34"> Health care -- it is no longer the case in the United States that you go to the doctor, and the doctor tells you what to do.  </seg>
<seg id="35"> Instead, you go to the doctor, and the doctor tells you, "Well, we could do A, or we could do B.  </seg>
<seg id="36"> A has these benefits, and these risks.  </seg>
<seg id="37"> B has these benefits, and these risks. What do you want to do?"  </seg>
<seg id="38"> And you say, "Doc, what should I do?"  </seg>
<seg id="39"> And the doc says, "A has these benefits and risks, and B has these benefits and risks.  </seg>
<seg id="40"> What do you want to do?"  </seg>
<seg id="41"> And you say, "If you were me, Doc, what would you do?"  </seg>
<seg id="42"> And the doc says, "But I'm not you."  </seg>
<seg id="43"> And the result is -- we call it "patient autonomy," which makes it sound like a good thing, but what it really is is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision-making from somebody who knows something -- namely, the doctor -- to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions -- namely, the patient.  </seg>
<seg id="44"> There's enormous marketing of prescription drugs to people like you and me, which, if you think about it, makes no sense at all, since we can't buy them.  </seg>
<seg id="45"> Why do they market to us if we can't buy them?  </seg>
<seg id="46"> The answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask for our prescriptions to be changed.  </seg>
<seg id="47"> Something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice, as this slide is meant to indicate.  </seg>
<seg id="48"> We don't inherit an identity; we get to invent it.  </seg>
<seg id="49"> And we get to re-invent ourselves as often as we like.  </seg>
<seg id="50"> And that means that everyday, when you wake up in the morning, you have to decide what kind of person you want to be.  </seg>
<seg id="51"> With respect to marriage and family, there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could, and then you started having kids as soon as you could.  </seg>
<seg id="52"> The only real choice was who, not when, and not what you did after.  </seg>
<seg id="53"> Nowadays, everything is very much up for grabs.  </seg>
<seg id="54"> I teach wonderfully intelligent students, and I assign 20 percent less work than I used to.  </seg>
<seg id="55"> And it's not because they're less smart, and it's not because they're less diligent.  </seg>
<seg id="56"> It's because they are preoccupied, asking themselves, "Should I get married or not? Should I get married now?  </seg>
<seg id="57"> Should I get married later? Should I have kids first, or a career first?"  </seg>
<seg id="58"> All of these are consuming questions.  </seg>
<seg id="59"> And they're going to answer these questions, whether or not it means not doing all the work I assign and not getting a good grade in my courses.  </seg>
<seg id="60"> And indeed they should. These are important questions to answer.  </seg>
<seg id="61"> Work -- we are blessed, as Carl was pointing out, with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet -- except the Randolph Hotel.  </seg>
<seg id="62"> There is one corner, by the way, that I'm not going to tell anybody about, where the WiFi works.  </seg>
<seg id="63"> I'm not telling you about it because I want to use it.  </seg>
<seg id="64"> So what this means, this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work, is that we have to make a decision, again and again and again, about whether we should or shouldn't be working.  </seg>
<seg id="65"> We can go to watch our kid play soccer, and we have our cell phone on one hip, and our Blackberry on our other hip, and our laptop, presumably, on our laps.  </seg>
<seg id="66"> And even if they're all shut off, every minute that we're watching our kid mutilate a soccer game, we are also asking ourselves, "Should I answer this cell phone call?  </seg>
<seg id="67"> Should I respond to this email? Should I draft this letter?"  </seg>
<seg id="68"> And even if the answer to the question is "no," it's certainly going to make the experience of your kid's soccer game very different than it would've been.  </seg>
<seg id="69"> So everywhere we look, big things and small things, material things and lifestyle things, life is a matter of choice.  </seg>
<seg id="70"> And the world we used to live in looked like this.  </seg>
<seg id="71"> That is to say, there were some choices, but not everything was a matter of choice.  </seg>
<seg id="72"> And the world we now live in looks like this.  </seg>
<seg id="73"> And the question is, is this good news, or bad news?  </seg>
<seg id="74"> And the answer is yes.  </seg>
<seg id="75"> We all know what's good about it, so I'm going to talk about what's bad about it.  </seg>
<seg id="76"> All of this choice has two effects, two negative effects on people.  </seg>
<seg id="77"> One effect, paradoxically, is that it produces paralysis, rather than liberation.  </seg>
<seg id="78"> With so many options to choose from, people find it very difficult to choose at all.  </seg>
<seg id="79"> I'll give you one very dramatic example of this: a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans.  </seg>
<seg id="80"> A colleague of mine got access to investment records from Vanguard, the gigantic mutual fund company of about a million employees and about 2,000 different workplaces.  </seg>
<seg id="81"> And what she found is that for every 10 mutual funds the employer offered, rate of participation went down two percent.  </seg>
<seg id="82"> You offer 50 funds -- 10 percent fewer employees participate than if you only offer five. Why?  </seg>
<seg id="83"> Because with 50 funds to choose from, it's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose that you'll just put it off until tomorrow.  </seg>
<seg id="84"> And then tomorrow, and then tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, and of course tomorrow never comes.  </seg>
<seg id="85"> Understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they retire because they don't have enough money put away, it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant matching money from the employer.  </seg>
<seg id="86"> By not participating, they are passing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year from the employer, who would happily match their contribution.  </seg>
<seg id="87"> So paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices.  </seg>
<seg id="88"> And I think it makes the world look like this.  </seg>
<seg id="89"> You really want to get the decision right if it's for all eternity, right?  </seg>
<seg id="90"> You don't want to pick the wrong mutual fund, or even the wrong salad dressing.  </seg>
<seg id="91"> So that's one effect. The second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice, we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from.  </seg>
<seg id="92"> And there are several reasons for this.  </seg>
<seg id="93"> One of them is that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from, if you buy one, and it's not perfect -- and, you know, what salad dressing is? -- it's easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better. And what happens is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made, and this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made, even if it was a good decision.  </seg>
<seg id="94"> The more options there are, the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disappointing about the option that you chose.  </seg>
<seg id="95"> Second, what economists call "opportunity costs."  </seg>
<seg id="96"> Dan Gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to.  </seg>
<seg id="97"> Well, when there are lots of alternatives to consider, it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject, that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen.  </seg>
<seg id="98"> Here's an example. For those of you who aren't New Yorkers, I apologize.  </seg>
<seg id="99"> But here's what you're supposed to be thinking.  </seg>
<seg id="100"> Here's this couple on the Hamptons.  </seg>
<seg id="101"> Very expensive real estate.  </seg>
<seg id="102"> Gorgeous beach. Beautiful day. They have it all to themselves.  </seg>
<seg id="103"> What could be better? "Well, damn it," this guy is thinking, "It's August.  </seg>
<seg id="104"> Everybody in my Manhattan neighborhood is away.  </seg>
<seg id="105"> I could be parking right in front of my building."  </seg>
<seg id="106"> And he spends two weeks nagged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity, day after day, to have a great parking space.  </seg>
<seg id="107"> Opportunity costs subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose, even when what we choose is terrific.  </seg>
<seg id="108"> And the more options there are to consider, the more attractive features of these options are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs.  </seg>
<seg id="109"> Here's another example.  </seg>
<seg id="110"> Now this cartoon makes a lot of points.  </seg>
<seg id="111"> It makes points about living in the moment as well, and probably about doing things slowly.  </seg>
<seg id="112"> But one point it makes is that whenever you're choosing one thing, you're choosing not to do other things.  </seg>
<seg id="113"> And those other things may have lots of attractive features, and it's going to make what you're doing less attractive.  </seg>
<seg id="114"> Third: escalation of expectations.  </seg>
<seg id="115"> This hit me when I went to replace my jeans.  </seg>
<seg id="116"> I wear jeans almost all the time.  </seg>
<seg id="117"> And there was a time when jeans came in one flavor, and you bought them, and they fit like crap, and they were incredibly uncomfortable, and if you wore them long enough and washed them enough times, they started to feel OK.  </seg>
<seg id="118"> So I went to replace my jeans after years and years of wearing these old ones, and I said, you know, "I want a pair of jeans. Here's my size."  </seg>
<seg id="119"> And the shopkeeper said, "Do you want slim fit, easy fit, relaxed fit?  </seg>
<seg id="120"> You want button fly or zipper fly? You want stonewashed or acid-washed?  </seg>
<seg id="121"> Do you want them distressed?  </seg>
<seg id="122"> You want boot cut, you want tapered, blah blah blah ..." On and on he went.  </seg>
<seg id="123"> My jaw dropped, and after I recovered, I said, "I want the kind that used to be the only kind."  </seg>
<seg id="124"> He had no idea what that was, so I spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans, and I walked out of the store -- truth! -- with the best-fitting jeans I had ever had.  </seg>
<seg id="125"> I did better. All this choice made it possible for me to do better.  </seg>
<seg id="126"> But I felt worse.  </seg>
<seg id="127"> Why? I wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself.  </seg>
<seg id="128"> The reason I felt worse is that, with all of these options available, my expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up.  </seg>
<seg id="129"> I had very low -- I had no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor.  </seg>
<seg id="130"> When they came in 100 flavors, damn it, one of them should've been perfect.  </seg>
<seg id="131"> And what I got was good, but it wasn't perfect.  </seg>
<seg id="132"> And so I compared what I got to what I expected, and what I got was disappointing in comparison to what I expected.  </seg>
<seg id="133"> Adding options to people's lives can't help but increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be.  </seg>
<seg id="134"> And what that's going to produce is less satisfaction with results, even when they're good results.  </seg>
<seg id="135"> Nobody in the world of marketing knows this, because if they did, you wouldn't all know what this was about.  </seg>
<seg id="136"> The truth is more like this.  </seg>
<seg id="137"> The reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse, it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise.  </seg>
<seg id="138"> Nowadays, the world we live in -- we affluent, industrialized citizens, with perfection the expectation -- the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be.  </seg>
<seg id="139"> You will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations, my expectations, have gone through the roof.  </seg>
<seg id="140"> The secret to happiness -- this is what you all came for -- the secret to happiness is low expectations.  </seg>
<seg id="141"> I want to say -- just a little autobiographical moment -- that I actually am married to a wife, and she's really quite wonderful.  </seg>
<seg id="142"> I couldn't have done better. I didn't settle.  </seg>
<seg id="143"> But settling isn't always such a bad thing.  </seg>
<seg id="144"> Finally, one consequence of buying a bad-fitting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dissatisfied, and you ask why, who's responsible, the answer is clear: the world is responsible. What could you do?  </seg>
<seg id="145"> When there are hundreds of different styles of jeans available, and you buy one that is disappointing, and you ask why, who's responsible?  </seg>
<seg id="146"> It is equally clear that the answer to the question is you.  </seg>
<seg id="147"> You could have done better.  </seg>
<seg id="148"> With a hundred different kinds of jeans on display, there is no excuse for failure.  </seg>
<seg id="149"> And so when people make decisions, and even though the results of the decisions are good, they feel disappointed about them; they blame themselves.  </seg>
<seg id="150"> Clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation.  </seg>
<seg id="151"> I believe a significant -- not the only, but a significant -- contributor to this explosion of depression, and also suicide, is that people have experiences that are disappointing because their standards are so high, and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves, they think they're at fault.  </seg>
<seg id="152"> And so the net result is that we do better in general, objectively, and we feel worse.  </seg>
<seg id="153"> So let me remind you.  </seg>
<seg id="154"> This is the official dogma, the one that we all take to be true, and it's all false. It is not true.  </seg>
<seg id="155"> There's no question that some choice is better than none, but it doesn't follow from that that more choice is better than some choice.  </seg>
<seg id="156"> There's some magical amount. I don't know what it is.  </seg>
<seg id="157"> I'm pretty confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve our welfare.  </seg>
<seg id="158"> Now, as a policy matter -- I'm almost done -- as a policy matter, the thing to think about is this: what enables all of this choice in industrial societies is material affluence.  </seg>
<seg id="159"> There are lots of places in the world, and we have heard about several of them, where their problem is not that they have too much choice.  </seg>
<seg id="160"> Their problem is that they have too little.  </seg>
<seg id="161"> So the stuff I'm talking about is the peculiar problem of modern, affluent, Western societies.  </seg>
<seg id="162"> And what is so frustrating and infuriating is this: Steve Levitt talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficult-to-install child seats don't help. It's a waste of money.  </seg>
<seg id="163"> What I'm telling you is that these expensive, complicated choices -- it's not simply that they don't help.  </seg>
<seg id="164"> They actually hurt.  </seg>
<seg id="165"> They actually make us worse off.  </seg>
<seg id="166"> If some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shifted to societies in which people have too few options, not only would those people's lives be improved, but ours would be improved also.  </seg>
<seg id="167"> This is what economists call a "Pareto-improving move."  </seg>
<seg id="168"> Income redistribution will make everyone better off -- not just poor people -- because of how all this excess choice plagues us.  </seg>
<seg id="169"> So to conclude. You're supposed to read this cartoon, and, being a sophisticated person, say, "Ah! What does this fish know?  </seg>
<seg id="170"> You know, nothing is possible in this fishbowl."  </seg>
<seg id="171"> Impoverished imagination, a myopic view of the world -- and that's the way I read it at first.  </seg>
<seg id="172"> The more I thought about it, however, the more I came to the view that this fish knows something.  </seg>
<seg id="173"> Because the truth of the matter is that if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible, you don't have freedom. You have paralysis.  </seg>
<seg id="174"> If you shatter this fishbowl so that everything is possible, you decrease satisfaction.  </seg>
<seg id="175"> You increase paralysis, and you decrease satisfaction.  </seg>
<seg id="176"> Everybody needs a fishbowl.  </seg>
<seg id="177"> This one is almost certainly too limited -- perhaps even for the fish, certainly for us.  </seg>
<seg id="178"> But the absence of some metaphorical fishbowl is a recipe for misery, and, I suspect, disaster.  </seg>
<seg id="179"> Thank you very much.  </seg>
